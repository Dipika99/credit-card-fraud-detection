# credit-card-fraud-detection
Welcome to our study on credit card fraud detection! We use big data analytics in this repository to create sophisticated tools for identifying fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset was the dataset that was downloaded from Kaggle for this research.The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection

# Overview
Our project's main goal is to equip financial institutions to fight credit card fraud by using cutting-edge machine learning models and scalable data processing frameworks. Our mission is to deliver actionable insights from massive data repositories, with a particular focus on the finance industry. This will allow us to take preventative steps against fraudulent activity and boost confidence in electronic payment systems.

# Working Code
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Colab Notebook on Google (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zhzET4-u0tWPvxXUjcccSkZZcOe0V6FC?authuser=2#scrollTo=5_V66KbxtBUl) provides the working code and implementation information. Preprocessing data, training models, evaluating them, and visualising the results are all included in the notebook.

# Usage
To utilise this project with your own dataset, just take these actions:

1. Put your own data in place of the dataset path found in the given code.
2. Make the necessary changes in accordance with the schema of your dataset.
